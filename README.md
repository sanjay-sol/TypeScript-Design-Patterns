# TypeScript Design Patterns

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. 

## 2. Observer Pattern or PubSub Pattern

The Observer Pattern, also known as the PubSub (Publish-Subscribe) Pattern, defines a one-to-many dependency 
between objects. When one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.


## 3. Visitor Pattern

The Visitor Pattern allows adding new operations to existing classes without modifying them. It achieves this by separating the algorithm from the object structure.

## 4. Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the client using it.

## 5. Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It encapsulates object creation logic.
